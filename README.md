Hi there!👋 I'm Natthanan — or you can call me Narngisa.
=========================

I'm a high school student and aspiring programmer from Wat Nuannoradit School. I have a strong passion for problem-solving, especially through programming and storytelling. In my free time, I enjoy drawing and writing fiction, which often inspires and shapes my software projects.

My main interests lie in both front-end and back-end web development, where I’ve built a solid foundation through personal projects and continuous learning. I'm currently expanding my skill set by exploring new programming languages, enhancing my GitHub portfolio, and seeking new opportunities to grow as a developer. I’m always eager to combine creativity with technology to build meaningful and engaging digital experiences.
